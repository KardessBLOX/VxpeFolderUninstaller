# Hi there
If you're uninstalling a Vape config, you're at the right place

### This is the main script.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KardessBLOX/VxpeFolderUninstaller/main/uninstall_main", true))()
``

### This is open source!
Skid this script as much as you want. I don't care.
