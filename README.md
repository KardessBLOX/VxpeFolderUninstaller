# Hi there
If you're uninstalling a Vape config, you're at the right place

### This is the main script.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KardessBLOX/VxpeFolderUninstaller/main/uninstall_main", true))()
```

# Render Intents
This script is designed for Render Intents. But it can work for other configs or your original vape.

### This is open source!
Skid this script as much as you want. I don't care.

# Credits
Kardess - ```Identifying executor - Notifications and callbacks```
Sammz - ```Delete all Vape files - Detects if vape folder is already deleted```

# ⚠️CAUTION⚠️
This script is still in beta, you may experience issues as such as: Not loading, Notification only executing, False detection of no Vape folder

### No Wave Allowed
Wave is detected and they messed up bypassing HWID thingy. So we made this script Wave proof by using ```identifyexecutor```.
